# *Hi there, I'm Tabassum!*

**ABOUT**
> Beginning my journey from working on the **clinical and management** domain of healthcare, I identified that there is a huge influx of data which is yet to be explored 
> effectively. Having basic knowledge about **Applied Statistics and Mathematics**, I realised all this data looks like that 1000 pieces puzzle I solved in the 7th 
> grade. Finding out insights and identifying patterns out of large messy data is the challenge that makes me want get up from bed everyday. With my **Master's in Health
> Informatics (Major in Data Science)**, I'm enthusiatic to apply my knowledge and skills in real-time to solve those big data problems and bring impacts to the lives of 
> people. 

**HIGHLIGHTS OF MY RECENT WORK**
> DEVELOPING ETL TOOLS AND PIPELINES
