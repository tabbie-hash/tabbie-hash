# *Hi there, I'm Tabassum!*

**ABOUT**
> Beginning my journey from working on the **clinical and management** domain of healthcare, I identified that there is a huge influx of data which is yet to be explored 
> effectively. Having basic knowledge about **Applied Statistics and Mathematics**, I realised all this data looks like that 1000 pieces puzzle I solved in the 7th 
> grade. Finding out insights and identifying patterns out of large messy data is the challenge that makes me want get up from bed everyday. With my **Master's in Health
> Informatics (Major in Data Science)**, I'm enthusiatic to apply my knowledge and skills in real-time to solve those big data problems and bring impacts to the lives of 
> people. 

**HIGHLIGHTS OF MY RECENT WORK**
1. **DEVELOPING ETL TOOLS AND PIPELINES** 
> ![alt text](https://github.com/tabbie-hash/tabbie-hash/blob/main/Knime%20workflow.png)
> My work at Medalynx Inc. involves developing data pre-processing and data integration pipelines on Kinme Application. These files include rows in the mutliples of
> thousands consisting of data from the healthcare market. The goal of the project is build a standardized global database library for clients and researchers to remove 
> the hassle getting access to protected healthcare data. 

2. **PERFORMING USER EXPERIENCE ANALYSIS**

> I'm a **quick learner!** I love to work in areas other than my major. I performed user experience analysis of the Medalynx App for the external stakeholders and 
> presented the report to the developer team and the CEO.
