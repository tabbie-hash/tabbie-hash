# *Hi there, I'm Tabassum!*

## **ABOUT**
In my current role as a Data Scientist at Vizient Inc., I have successfully built machine-learning models utilizing Real-World EHR data. Notably, I developed a Physician Specialty Mapping model using XGBoost with precision and recall metrics of 0.85 and 0.83, respectively. Additionally, I built a Payer Plans Mapping model using BERT with precision and recall scores of 0.80 and 0.78. I also built an Automated Data Mining and Quality Assessment product prototype within 3 months, improving data quality assurance process time by 98% and significantly enhancing client engagements. I have also collaborated with cross-functional teams to research state-of-the-art LLMs (RAG pipeline applications) for advanced analytics products. These accomplishments showcase my ability to work with complex real-world data and deliver impactful solutions.

Furthermore, my experience as a Data Scientist at Michigan Medicine involved developing an algorithm for generating individualized Blood Glucose Level patterns using CGM data and conducting patient cohort analysis for the Diabetes Clinical Research Program. I co-authored a publication titled ![Continuous Glucose Monitoring with Low-Carbohydrate Nutritional Coaching Improves Type 2 Diabetes Control: A Randomized Quality Improvement Program Evaluation] (https://www.jmir.org/2022/2/e31184) in JMIR Journal and my recognition through the 2020 IHPI/HSR Summer Student Fellowship and Internship Program Award at the University of Michigan. These experiences have enhanced my proficiency in working with diverse real-world clinical data and extracting valuable insights using Precision Health and Evidence-based Medicine concepts. I am well-versed in programming languages such as Python and R and have expertise in data visualization tools like Tableau and PowerBI. My proficiency in data science libraries such as Scikit-learn, PyTorch, and TensorFlow enables me to apply advanced machine learning techniques, including NLP and PCA, to drive innovative solutions.

Additionally, my skills in data mining, predictive analytics, and statistics further strengthen my ability to analyze real-world big data. 

## **HIGHLIGHTS OF MY EARLY CAREER WORK**
1. **DEVELOPING ETL PIPELINES AND DEFINING MEDICAL DATA MODELS** 
> ![alt text](https://github.com/tabbie-hash/tabbie-hash/blob/main/Knime%20workflow.png)
> My work at Medalynx Inc. involves developing data pre-processing and data integration pipelines on Kinme Application. These files include rows in the mutliples of
> thousands consisting of data from the healthcare market. The goal of the project is build a standardized global database library for clients and researchers to remove 
> the hassle getting access to protected healthcare data. 

2. **PERFORMING USER EXPERIENCE ANALYSIS**
> ![alt text](https://github.com/tabbie-hash/tabbie-hash/blob/main/app%20analysis.png)                                                                 
> I'm a **quick learner!** I love to work in areas other than my major. I performed user experience analysis of the Medalynx Web App for the external stakeholders and 
> presented the report to the developer team and the CEO. 

3. **ALGORITHM TO ANALYZE CGM DATA** *(Human Computer Interaction)*
   #### PERSONALISED GLUCOSE LEVELS VISUALIZATION

   #### NUMBER OF PEAKS AND CRASHES IN THE GLUCOSE LEVELS THROUGHOUT THE RESEARCH STUDY                        
> ![alt text](https://github.com/tabbie-hash/tabbie-hash/blob/main/P001S6_All_Sensors_PC.png)                                                                                      
> My work at Michigan Medicine involves working of the big data files from the CGMs and developing a **Patient-Physician Education Tool** for helping Type2 Diabetes 
> patients enrolled in the research study understand their condition. This tool allows patients to see their glucose levels in real-time along with the affect of food 
> on it and interact with the visualization and see how their glucose levels became steady by just incorporating some lifestyle changes.  

4. **QUALITATIVE DATA ANALYSIS**
> ![alt text](https://github.com/tabbie-hash/tabbie-hash/blob/main/qual%20analysis.png)                                     
> In the same research study at Michigan Medicine I worked on not only quantitive data analysis aspect but also on the qualitative data analysis. After carefully 
> analyzing the patient interview transcripts and developing the qualitative codes, the qualitative analysis was performed using MAQDA application. The work is 
> incorporated in the main paper of the research study in which I'm a co-author.
