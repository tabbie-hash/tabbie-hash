# *Hi there, I'm Tabassum!*

## **ABOUT**
> Since my advent in the **clinical and management** domain of healthcare, I identified that there is a huge influx of data that is yet to be explored effectively. 
> Having basic knowledge about **Applied Statistics and Mathematics**, I found all this data looks like the "Ele-Phantastic 1000 pieces puzzle" [multiple elephant 
> pieces in a Giant Elephant piece](https://www.amazon.com/Ele-Phantastic-1000-pc-Jigsaw-Puzzle/dp/B004HK6BL6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B004HK6BL6&pd_rd_r=9761960c-0f86-11e9-81fe-4da2503c3c0e&pd_rd_w=mSuow&pd_rd_wg=Hl2sh&pf_rd_p=18bb0b78-4200-49b9-ac91-f141d61a1780&pf_rd_r=WAD926SEW7SVXNMCV35X&psc=1&refRID=WAD926SEW7SVXNMCV35X&linkCode=sl1&tag=mybuclisjou-20&linkId=5a0bdf477cfe6dc46b4ecc22b793e6cb&language=en_US) that I solved in the 7th grade.

> I realized:
  > **Everything can be related to something and that something defines something else which can explain a lot of things** -- *Tabassum Nisha* **and I am good at 
  > that.** 
> 
> My insatiable curiosity in identifying patterns and finding insights out of large messy data makes me want to get up from my bed every day. With my **Master's in 
> Health Informatics (Major in Data Science)**, I'm enthusiastic to apply my knowledge and skills to solve those big data problems and bring impacts to the lives of 
> people. 

## **HIGHLIGHTS OF MY WORK**
1. **DEVELOPING ETL TOOLS AND PIPELINES** 
> ![alt text](https://github.com/tabbie-hash/tabbie-hash/blob/main/Knime%20workflow.png)
> My work at Medalynx Inc. involves developing data pre-processing and data integration pipelines on Kinme Application. These files include rows in the mutliples of
> thousands consisting of data from the healthcare market. The goal of the project is build a standardized global database library for clients and researchers to remove 
> the hassle getting access to protected healthcare data. 

2. **PERFORMING USER EXPERIENCE ANALYSIS**
> ![alt text](https://github.com/tabbie-hash/tabbie-hash/blob/main/app%20analysis.png)                                                                 
> I'm a **quick learner!** I love to work in areas other than my major. I performed user experience analysis of the Medalynx Web App for the external stakeholders and 
> presented the report to the developer team and the CEO. 

3. **INTERACTIVE VISUALIZATION OF CGM DATA** *(Human Computer Interaction)*
   #### GLUCOSE LEVELS VISUALIZATION
> ![alt text](https://github.com/tabbie-hash/tabbie-hash/blob/main/graph.png)       
   #### NUMBER OF PEAKS AND CRASHES IN THE GLUCOSE LEVELS THROUGHOUT THE RESEARCH STUDY                        
> ![alt text](https://github.com/tabbie-hash/tabbie-hash/blob/main/P001S6_All_Sensors_PC.png)                                                                                      
> My work at Michigan Medicine involves working of the big data files from the CGMs and developing a **Patient-Physician Education Tool** for helping Type2 Diabetes 
> patients enrolled in the research study understand their condition. This tool allows patients to see their glucose levels in real-time along with the affect of food 
> on it and interact with the visualization and see how their glucose levels became steady by just incorporating some lifestyle changes.  

4. **QUALITATIVE DATA ANALYSIS**
> ![alt text](https://github.com/tabbie-hash/tabbie-hash/blob/main/qual%20analysis.png)                                     
> In the same research study at Michigan Medicine I worked on not only quantitive data analysis aspect but also on the qualitative data analysis. After carefully 
> analyzing the patient interview transcripts and developing the qualitative codes, the qualitative analysis was performed using MAQDA application. The work is 
> incorporated in the main paper of the research study in which I'm a co-author.
